# CSC-42021: Simplicial complexes for topological data analysis

# How to run

We used Python 3.12.3 with the dependecies in ```requirements.txt```

Just run the ```main.py``` and it'll run all the tests. Otherwise, feel free to use ours functions and algorithms as you wish.

The general content of each file is described down bellow.

# Files

- ```main.py```: A suite of tests from all the required tasks.
- ```src/algorithms.py```: All the core algorithms to solve the tasks.
- ```src/ball.py```: Ball class that is used to facilitate the use of any dimension.
- ```src/constants.py```: Defines epsilon for float equality.
- ```src/graphics.py```: Function and helper function to plot the simplexes in 3D.
- ```src/tests.py```: File with the implementation of each test in detail.
